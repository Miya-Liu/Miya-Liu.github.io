                            It must be a unique experience passing viva in a quarantine hotel. The viva is a great discussion
                            to improve my thesis instead of an examination to me, thanks to my examiners and their wonderful suggestions.

                            Working is different with studying. <br>
                            Different from my PhD experience, my supervisors make suggestions on my research,
                            but do not making decisions for me. While I am working as an intern for
                            a research group, the mode I sense now is that I provide research methods and results,
                            others will make the decisions. More to learn.

                            'You can't wait life isn't hard anymore before you decide to be happy.'<br>
                            I heard this sentence from a singer who performed in AGT and was fighting against cancer at the time.
                            It is so right. Lift can not always be easy or bright for you but hard and stressful at most time.
                            What we can control is how to face and live our life. Try to be positive and peaceful.

                            We start quarantine this month. The uni was shutdown and every module has to be online.<br>
                            I keep wondering whether holography can be used in online module. If we can create a virtual
                            classroom, and then use holography to present students and lectures in the classroom, it would
                            be a more 'realistic' classroom for us all in this pandemic time.

                            Lyon is a peaceful and colorful city. I did not realise that French people love exercise.
                            There are people running on the street and street market selling article pieces everywhere.
                            This summer school gathers people in database field and they tend to be well organised and
                            pay more attention on theory analysis.

                            Summer School in Italy.<br>
                            Visit Italy for the first time and lived in a castle on the top of a hill. The weather and people remind me of summer in China.
                            I already know that Italy and China have lots of cultural similarity from talks with my Italian
                            Friends, but never get the feeling for real. And I had a great time in the summer school with
                            terrific tutors and amazing teammates.

                            Meet my supervisor for the first time and say hi to my second supervisor in a toilet. <br>
                            I met my supervisor in person for the first time. She explained me what PhD is and what I can expect from it by
                            a metaphor of painting. I would be the one who hold the brush and dream about what to paint.
                            She would be the one who offer colors and point out where to explore the paintings of others. I was noticed that
                            I have another supervisor to whom I should introduce myself. I happened to meet her in the toilet.
                            Guess what. I did say hi to her, she kindly introduced herself to me as well. Let's call it a good start.
